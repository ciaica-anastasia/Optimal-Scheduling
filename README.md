# Optimal-Scheduling

Found an optimal solution for the nurse scheduling problem (NP-hard) - the operations research problem of finding an optimal way to assign employees to shifts, using simulated annealing algorithm. Took into account hard (employee coverage, prohibited working patterns) and soft (individual work preferences) constraints.
Justified the choice of this algorithm over the genetic algorithm. Conducted an analysis of the results.
